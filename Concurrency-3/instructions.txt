NOTE: sem_init is deprecated on MacOS. As in, this program won't operate correctly on a Mac due to the semaphore not being initialized.To run our program type ./goo (you may have to chmod +x goo) • This is a script that calls	• make clean	• make,	• clear	• ./concurrencyGame Plan	• Let the chopsticks be an array of mutexes	• Let there be a semaphore only allowing four philosophers to eat at a time	• The ith Philosopher thinks	• When the ith philosopher wants to eat and there is space (i.e. semaphore	  allows)		- Wait for chopstick[i]		- Wait for chopstick[ (i+1) % 5] 
		- Eat		- When done eating			* Signal chopstick[i]			* Signal chopstick [ (i+1 ) % 5]	• The ith Philosopher thinksYou can see that our solution works by viewing the programs output (the table). A philosopher will have a ? next to their name if they're thinking. A philosopher will have a \/ next to their name if they're eating. You can see that no two adjacent philosophers are eating.
